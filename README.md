# iRacing LMP1H Hybrid Deployment Utility
This is the beginning of a small utility to calculate when and how much hybrid energy in real time while driving one of iRacing's LMP1H (Audi R18 and Porsche 919) cars.

# Dependencies
This utility's code relies on the following python libraries:
- pyirsdk (https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk)
- Scikit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- Numpy (https://numpy.org/install/)
- Pytorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# Usage
To start the utility run the main.py file using python3 such as: ```python main.py```
The utility will notify the user via the command line upon connection/disconnection to an iRacing client.
