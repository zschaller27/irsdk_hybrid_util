Main Idea:

Utility that automatically determines how much hybrid boost to deploy at any given time.
    - Needs to "learn" the track to find the straights
    - Needs to calculate regen from braking (also under accel for porsche)

Steps:
    - Figure out when a new lap starts  DONE
        - Use 'LapDistPct' to find when a new lap ticks over.
    
    - Time at full throttle
